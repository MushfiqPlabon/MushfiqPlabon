## Positioning Statement

I build **end-to-end web applications** with a strong backend core (Django / DRF) and modern frontend delivery (React).  
My background in **business operations and management** lets me design systems that solve **real operational problems**, not just pass tutorials.

I focus on:
- Clean backend architecture
- Practical full-stack delivery
- Maintainability over hype
- Shipping complete systems, not fragments

---

## Core Stack

**Backend**
- Python, Django, Django REST Framework
- Authentication, role-based access, REST APIs
- PostgreSQL, SQLite

**Frontend**
- React, Redux Toolkit
- HTML, CSS, Tailwind CSS
- Responsive, user-focused UI

**Infrastructure & Tools**
- Git, GitHub
- Vercel, Render
- Supabase
- API documentation (Swagger)
- AI-assisted development workflows (used as productivity tools, not crutches)

## Flagship Projects

### 🏠 HomeSer — Household Service Platform
**Full-stack service marketplace**

**Tech:** React, Redux, Django REST Framework, PostgreSQL  
**Repos:**  
- Frontend → https://github.com/MushfiqPlabon/homeser-frontend-react  
- Backend → https://github.com/MushfiqPlabon/homeser-backend-drf  

**What this proves**
- Designed a real multi-role system (Admin / Client)
- Built REST APIs for booking, order management, and user profiles
- Implemented authentication and structured backend logic
- Separated frontend and backend cleanly (production-style architecture)

This is not a demo page — it’s a **complete system design exercise**.

### 🎟️ EventMan — Event Management System
**Server-rendered, performance-focused web app**

**Tech:** Django (MVT), HTMX, PostgreSQL, Cloudinary  
**Repo:** https://github.com/MushfiqPlabon/EventMan  

**What this proves**
- Strong understanding of Django’s core architecture
- Server-side rendering with modern interactivity (HTMX)
- Media handling and third-party service integration
- Preference for **simplicity and performance** over unnecessary SPA complexity

---

### 🚌 RoutePy / busManPy — CLI System Design Project
**Procedural vs OOP comparison**

**Tech:** Python  
**What this proves**
- Understanding of OOP fundamentals
- Ability to reason about design trade-offs
- Not just “writing code”, but **thinking about structure**

---

## Learning Path (Intentional, Not Random)

- **Stanford Code in Place 2025** — Python fundamentals  
- **Phitron (Programming Hero)** — CS fundamentals, OOP, DSA, databases  
- **freeCodeCamp / Sololearn / Coursera** — Web foundations, React, data handling  

I deliberately prioritized:
1. Core programming fundamentals  
2. Backend architecture  
3. Full-stack system completion  

---

## What I’m Actively Improving

- Writing tighter project documentation
- Adding tests to existing systems
- Improving API design consistency
- Preparing projects for real users, not just portfolios

---

## What I’m Looking For

- Entry-level / junior **backend or full-stack roles**
- Teams that value **clean systems and learning velocity**
- Opportunities where shipping > buzzwords
